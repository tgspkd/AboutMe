## Projects

Besides programming, I have engineering experience with building, modifying, and repairing various devices such as computers, bicycles, and remote control vehicles. **[Here](https://photos.app.goo.gl/p42X9M8gGHEwWnZT9)** is an album of my rc crawler.

[Here](https://photos.app.goo.gl/eXsQUx4WaEwwNv9p6) is another album for a gaming PC that I built using a Dell Optiplex 7010 motherboard, various components scrounged from eBay, and a case from Facebook Marketplace.
